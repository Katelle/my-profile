	<h1>Hello, I am Katelle! Welcome on my page!</h1>
	<p>

	<h2>Trips</h2>

		<p>Whether with friends, family or even alone, I have always loved to travel. I have had the opportunity to visit the United States, India, Morocco, Italy and many other countries with rich and varied cultures.</p>
		<p>This taste for travel was a deciding factor in my choice of post-baccalaureate studies. Joining IESEG allowed me to do an exchange year in Zagreb in Croatia as well as a two-month internship in Ireland in Dublin at <a href="https://www.scor.com/en" target="_blank">
		SCOR</a> (a reinsurrance company). These experiences make me living alone in a foreign country for the first time at the age of 19 which allowed me to develop my curiosity and my ability to adapt very fast.

	<h2>Fashion</h2>

	<p id="text-fashion">
		<p>I have always been passionate about fashion. I've been reading Vogue since I was 15. And as a teenager, I loved to take back old clothes from my mother and have them cut to give them a new life: not to lose beautiful materials and simply to bring the clothes up to date.</p>
		<p>I took advantage of my internships to be in direct contact with my passion since I did :<ul>
		<li>My commercial internship as a saleswoman at <a href="https://leclaireur.com/" target="_blank">
		l'Eclaireur</a>: a luxury concept store located a few steps from the Place des Victoires in Paris</li>
		<li>My internship as an E-commerce manager at <a href="https://lesappretes.com/" target="_blank">
		Les Apprêtés</a>: an eco-responsible clothing box rental company</li></ul></p>
		<p>My internship at Les Apprêtés allowed me to learn more about the type of consumption I wanted to adopt. In a world where the textile industry is the second most polluting in the world and where thousands of workers are forced to work in deplorable conditions, I think it's time to move to a more ethical mode of consumption: for the planet as well as for the human being.</p>

	<h2>Sport</h2>

	<p id="text-sport">
		<p>Passionate about sports since childhood, I practiced handball in a club for three years and swimming for five years. Although I no longer play handball, I continue to be an avid supporter of the Paris Saint Germain handball team and the French handball team.</p>  
		<p>I think that these sports activities allowed me to work on my perseverance, which is an asset in my personal and professional life.</p>
		<p>Today, I go to the <a href="https://dynamo-cycling.com/" target="_blank">dynamo cycling gym</a> at least once a week. Dynamo is a sport that revolutionizes indoor cycling by offering a complete workout that connects the body and mind in rhythm with the music: 10% in the legs and 90% in the head!
		Although very fun, this sport requires a strong mind and a lot of coordination.
